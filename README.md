=============

This program features a class that has a static method named writeArray. The method takes two arguments: the name of a file and a reference to an int array. The file is then opened as a binary file, the contents of the array written to the file, and the file is closed. A second method, readArray, is then written. readArray takes two arguments: the name of a file and a reference to an int array. The file is opened, data is read from the file, stored in an array, and then the file is closed.
